To ensure our communication remains private and authenticated, I use PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) encryption. PGP allows you to encrypt messages to me and verify my digital signature.

Using PGP is especially recommended when:
- You’re sending sensitive or personal information
- You want to verify that a message genuinely came from me
- You care about privacy and data integrity

If you’d like to communicate securely, please use my public key below.
