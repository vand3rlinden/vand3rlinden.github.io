In this post, you will learn how to enable and use SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online.

While outbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online has been enabled since 2022, Microsoft is has rolling out inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online since late 2024.

For a deeper understanding of DNSSEC and DANE, take a look at my earlier blog post.

How SMTP DANE with DNSSEC works
SMTP DANE is a transport security mechanism (TLS enforcement) that protects SMTP delivery to a domain by using DNSSEC validated TLSA records to allow a sending (outbound) mail server to verify the TLS certificate of a receiving (inbound) mail server using TLSA records published in the DNS of the receiving domain.

This helps ensure that TLS connections between mail servers cannot be intercepted or downgraded, protecting against attacks such as TLS downgrade and man-in-the-middle attacks.\nSince port 25 does not use authentication (MTA-to-MTA delivery), implementing SMTP DANE enforces TLS encryption and certificate validation between MTA’s, this ensures the confidentiality of email delivery.\nThe flow of SMTP DANE on a mailserver Outbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC sending mail server: Requests DANE TLSA records of the receiving domain’s MX record. Inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC receiving mail server: Requires DNSSEC and DANE TLSA records that can be requested by the sending mail server. TLS Reporting (TLSRPT): If the sending mail server encounters issues delivering an email, it can use the receiving server’s TLSRPT record to report the problem or confirm that the TLS session was successfully established. Prerequisites Before you enable inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online for a domain, you must have added the domain as an Accepted domain and the domain status must be Healthy in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. The current domain’s MX record must have a priority of 0 or 10 and must not have a fallback or secondary MX record.\nMake sure that DNSSEC is enabled for your domain at your DNS provider.\nYou can use the DNSSEC Analyzer from VeriSign, to check if your DNS provider have DNSSEC enabled for your domain. You must be authorized to access Exchange Online PowerShell and to run the cmdlets.\nThe domain you want to secure with inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC must referenced to an MX record such as yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com.\nTo configure inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC for your Accepted Domain, such as yourdomain.com, ensure that:\nIf this domain is referenced in any smarthost configurations, or in any connectors, you need to switch the smarthost name to tenantname.mail.protection.outlook.com Your business partners update their connectors to tenantname.onmicrosoft.com or tenantname.mail.protection.outlook.com to avoid failures. After enabling DANE, partners can switch to the new yourdomain-com..mx.microsoft endpoint to restore the original connection. Set up inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online Below is a simplified version of the implementation compared to the official Microsoft Learn documentation.\nUpdate the TTL of your existing MX record to the lowest possible value (not lower than 30 seconds). Then, wait for the previous TTL to expire before proceeding. For example, if the TTL of your existing MX record was 3600 seconds or 1 hour before you changed it, you need to wait 1 hour before proceeding. Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell If you’re using MTA-STS, you’ll need to set your policy mode to testing during configuration, and set it back to enforced after configuration.\nEnable DNSSEC on your accepted domain by running the cmdlet in PowerShell: Enable-DnssecForVerifiedDomain -DomainName yourdomain.com Take the DnssecMxValue value, navigate to the DNS registrar hosting the domain, add a new MX record: 20 yourdomain-com..mx.microsoft and set the TTL to the lowest possible value (not lower than 30 seconds). Verify that the new MX is working via the Inbound SMTP Email test Change the priority of the legacy MX record yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com from current priority to 30 (30 yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com) Wait a minute\nChange the priority of the new MX record to 0 (0 yourdomain-com..mx.microsoft) Wait a minute\nDelete the legacy MX record yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com Wait a minute\nUpdate the TTL for the new MX record yourdomain-com..mx.microsoft to 3600 seconds or 1 hour Enable SMTP DANE for that same domain once the DNSSEC enablement is complete by running the cmdlet: Enable-SmtpDaneInbound -DomainName yourdomain.com Verify that the TLSA record has been propagated (this can take 15-30 minutes) by using the DANE Validation in Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer Check the health of your domain’s MX record in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center under ‘DNS Records’. Cmdlets to get DNSSEC and SMTP DANE configuration settings in Exchange Online # DNSSEC Get-DnssecStatusForVerifiedDomain -DomainName yourdomain.com | Select-Object DnssecFeatureStatus $DNSSEC = Get-DnssecStatusForVerifiedDomain -DomainName yourdomain.com $DNSSEC.ExpectedMxRecord $DNSSEC = Get-DnssecStatusForVerifiedDomain -DomainName yourdomain.com $DNSSEC.DnsValidation $DNSSEC = Get-DnssecStatusForVerifiedDomain -DomainName yourdomain.com $DNSSEC.MxValidation # DNSSEC - MTA-STS Policy validation (check the validation only if you use an MTA-STS policy) $DNSSEC = Get-DnssecStatusForVerifiedDomain -DomainName yourdomain.com $DNSSEC.MtaStsValidation # SMTP DANE Get-SmtpDaneInboundStatus -DomainName yourdomain.com Validate the TLSA records SMTP DANE TLSA records for a receiving mail server should be located at _25._tcp.mx-host, where mx-host is the hostname of the receiving mail server (the MX value for inbound mail).\nYou can validate the TLSA records for an mx-host by using the dig command-line tool:\nValue: _25._tcp.yourdomain-com..mx.microsoft Type: TLSA You can also use an SMTP DANE/TLSA validator, such as the one provided by Mailhardener, to check whether TLSA records for SMTP DANE are configured correctly.\nRollback the change Since we carefully added the DNSSEC-signed MX record mx.microsoft alongside the existing mail.protection.outlook.com MX record, you can safely make this change without worrying about inbound email interruption. If something does go wrong, the change can be rolled back by doing the following:\nDisable SMTP DANE: Disable-SmtpDaneInbound -DomainName yourdomain.com Run: Get-MxRecordReport -Domain yourdomain.com to get your new current MX record Create a new MX record in your public DNS with the following hostname value and set the priority to 20: 20 yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com Make sure the MX record you created in step 2 is working by using the Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer If your mail flow works with the mail.protection.outlook.com MX record, run the following command: Disable-DnssecForVerifiedDomain -DomainName yourdomain.com Delete the DNSSEC MX record in your public DNS: 0 yourdomain-com..mx.microsoft Make sure the MX record you created in step 2 is the only MX record, and that it is set to priority 0 (highest priority) Confirm that the MX record matches the value in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center -\u003e Settings -\u003e Domains (first, select the domain, then, select the DNS records) Activate TLS Reporting (TLSRPT) TLS Reporting (TLSRPT) is a standard that provides a way to report when the TLS connection could not be established during email transmission.\nImplementation of TLSRPT Log in to your DNS hosting provider’s management console. Add a new TXT record with the following details: Host Type Value _smtp._tls.example.com TXT v=TLSRPTv1; rua=mailto:tlsrpt@example.com TLSRPT report handling If a sending mail server has issues securely delivering email to a receiving mail server, it can use the TLSRPT record published in the public DNS of the receiving domain to determine where to send a report about the problem or to report a successful TLS session.\nThe reports are received in .json, you can look for the summary tag to check if the TLS connection was failed or successful:\n\"summary\":{\"total-successful-session-count\":1,\"total-failure-session-count\":0} MTA-STS vs. SMTP DANE Neither SMTP DANE nor MTA-STS is universally better. SMTP DANE provides stronger security, but requires DNSSEC, and not every DNS provider supports DNSSEC yet. MTA-STS is easier to implement and provides good security through HTTPS and DNS. Using the two together can provide the best of both worlds, increasing security through a layered approach.\nThis layered approach is beneficial because MTA-STS enforces TLS through a secure HTTPS policy file and validates the TLS certificate of the receiving (inbound) mail server, while SMTP DANE provides similar protection by checking TLS fingerprints obtained from the TLSA records of the receiving domain’s MX host and comparing them with the fingerprints presented by the receiving (inbound) mail server of the receiving domain.\nMTA-STS and SMTP DANE vs. Outbound email authentication While SPF, DKIM, and DMARC focus on verifying the authenticity of email messages and ensuring they are sent from authorized domains for outbound email, SMTP DANE and MTA-STS focuses specifically on securely establishing TLS connections between mail servers. These protocols ensures that the sending mail server connects to the intended receiving inbound mail server with verified encryption.\nReference Announcing General Availability of Inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC for Exchange Online How SMTP DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) works DNSSEC Analyzer TLSA validator for inbound SMTP DANE TLS-RPT Record Checker TLSRPT is defined in RFC8460 ",

<p>SMTP DANE <code>TLSA</code> records for a receiving mail server should be located at <code>_25._tcp.mx-host</code>, where <code>mx-host</code> is the hostname of the receiving mail server (the <code>MX</code> value for inbound mail).</p>
<p>You can validate the <code>TLSA</code> records for an <code>mx-host</code> by using the <code>dig</code> command-line tool:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value: <code>_25._tcp.yourdomain-com.&lt;random&gt;.mx.microsoft</code></li>
<li>Type: <code>TLSA</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="IMAGE" loading="lazy" src="/images/exo-inbound-smtp-dane-dnssec/exo-inbound-smtp-dane-dnssec12.png"></p>
<p>You can also use an SMTP DANE/TLSA validator, such as the one provided by <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/tools/dane-validator">Mailhardener</a>, to check whether <code>TLSA</code> records for SMTP DANE are configured correctly.</p>
<h2 id="rollback-the-change">Rollback the change<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#rollback-the-change">#</a></h2>
<p>Since we carefully added the DNSSEC-signed MX record <code>mx.microsoft</code> alongside the existing <code>mail.protection.outlook.com</code> MX record, you can safely make this change without worrying about inbound email interruption. If something does go wrong, the change can be rolled back by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disable SMTP DANE: <code>Disable-SmtpDaneInbound -DomainName yourdomain.com</code></li>
<li>Run: <code>Get-MxRecordReport -Domain yourdomain.com</code> to get your new current MX record</li>
<li>Create a new MX record in your public DNS with the following hostname value and set the priority to <code>20</code>: <code>20 yourdomain-com.mail.protection.outlook.com</code></li>
<li>Make sure the MX record you created in step 2 is working by using the <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/O365InboundSmtp/input">Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer</a></li>
<li>If your mail flow works with the <code>mail.protection.outlook.com</code> MX record, run the following command: <code>Disable-DnssecForVerifiedDomain -DomainName yourdomain.com</code></li>
<li>Delete the DNSSEC MX record in your public DNS: <code>0 yourdomain-com.&lt;random&gt;.mx.microsoft</code></li>
<li>Make sure the MX record you created in step 2 is the only MX record, and that it is set to priority <code>0</code> (highest priority)</li>
<li>Confirm that the MX record matches the value in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center -&gt; Settings -&gt; Domains (first, select the domain, then, select the DNS records)</li>

<p>If a sending mail server has issues securely delivering email to a receiving mail server, it can use the <code>TLSRPT</code> record published in the public DNS of the receiving domain to determine where to send a report about the problem or to report a successful TLS session.</p>
<p>The reports are received in <code>.json</code>, you can look for the <code>summary</code> tag to check if the TLS connection was failed or successful:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;summary&#34;:{&#34;total-successful-session-count&#34;:1,&#34;total-failure-session-count&#34;:0}
</code></pre><h2 id="mta-sts-vs-smtp-dane">MTA-STS vs. SMTP DANE<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#mta-sts-vs-smtp-dane">#</a></h2>
<p>Neither SMTP DANE nor <a href="https://vand3rlinden.com/post/mta-sts-explained/">MTA-STS</a> is universally <strong>better</strong>. SMTP DANE provides stronger security, but requires DNSSEC, and not every DNS provider supports DNSSEC yet. MTA-STS is easier to implement and provides good security through <code>HTTPS</code> and DNS. Using the two together can provide the best of both worlds, increasing security through a layered approach.</p>
<p>This layered approach is beneficial because MTA-STS enforces TLS through a secure <code>HTTPS</code> policy file and validates the TLS certificate of the receiving (inbound) mail server, while SMTP DANE provides similar protection by checking TLS fingerprints obtained from the <code>TLSA</code> records of the receiving domain’s <code>MX</code> host and comparing them with the fingerprints presented by the receiving (inbound) mail server of the receiving domain.</p>

<p>While SPF, DKIM, and DMARC focus on verifying the authenticity of email messages and ensuring they are sent from authorized domains for outbound email, SMTP DANE and MTA-STS focuses specifically on securely establishing TLS connections between mail servers. These protocols ensures that the sending mail server connects to the intended receiving inbound mail server with verified encryption.</p>
