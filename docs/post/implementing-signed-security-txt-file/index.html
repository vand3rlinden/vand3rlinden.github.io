It helps ensure that security issues are directed to the right people quickly and efficiently. While it’s recommended to optionally sign the file with a PGP key for added authenticity, the primary goal is to clearly list how to reach your security team or responsible contact. Below, we’ll cover how to create a straightforward, effective security.txt file for your site.\nStep 1: Generate a PGP key pair If you don’t already have a PGP key pair, you’ll need to generate one. A PGP key pair consists of a public key, which you can share publicly, and a private key, which is kept secret.\n1. Install GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) GPG is the most common tool for generating and managing PGP keys. Install it using your package manager:\nLinux (Debian based): sudo apt-get install gnupg MacOS (via Homebrew): brew install gnupg Windows: winget install -e --id GnuPG.Gpg4win or direct download GPG4Win from https://gpg4win.org. 2. Generate the key pair Run the following command:\ngpg --full-generate-key Choose RSA and RSA for encryption. Select the desired key size (e.g., 4096 bits for stronger security). Set an expiration date (it is not recommended to select no expiration for permanent use). Enter your name and email address when prompted. Set a strong passphrase to secure the private key. Once complete, your keys will be stored in the GPG keyring. You can view your generated key pair, including the corresponding Fingerprint, by running the following commands to list the public and private keys:\nPublic key: gpg --list-keys Private key: gpg --list-secret-keys 3. Export your public key Others will need your public key to verify your signature:\ngpg --armor --export your_email@example.com \u003e pgp-publickey.txt This will export the public key to a file named pgp-publickey.txt.\nStep 2: Create and sign the security.txt file Create the security.txt file: Create a plain text file named security.txt with the following content (customize as needed):\n# Security address Contact: mailto:security@example.com # OpenPGP key Encryption: https://example.com/.well-known/pgp-publickey.txt # Expiration of security.txt file Expires: expiration date of your pgp key pair # Privacy Policy Policy: https://example.com/security-policy.html # Languages Preferred-Languages: EN, NL Sign the file with your Private Key: Use the following command to create a cleartext signature (replace the Fingerprint with the actual fingerprint):\ngpg --clearsign --local-user Fingerprint security.txt After you enter the passphrase to unlock the OpenPGP Private Key, a signature file security.txt.asc is created. Copy the content of security.txt.asc into the original security.txt file.\nHost the files: In the /.well-known/ folder on your webserver, upload the security.txt and pgp-publickey.txt files:\nhttps://example.com/.well-known/security.txt https://example.com/.well-known/pgp-publickey.txt NOTE: You could also consider hosting your PGP public key through a WKD or at keys.openpgp.org. For more information, please check my recent blog post.\nStep 3: Confirm authenticity and secure communication To confirm the authenticity of the security.txt file, anyone can verify it using your public key.\n1. Import the Public Key A user downloads your public key and imports it into their GPG keyring:\ngpg --import pgp-publickey.txt 2. Verify the Signature The user runs the following command to verify the signature:\ngpg --verify security.txt The PGP-signed security.txt file includes metadata that identifies your fingerprint; GPG then scans the user’s keyring to find your corresponding public key to verify the signature.\nIf the file is authentic, the user will see output confirming the signature, such as:\ngpg: Signature made Fri 23 Nov 2024 10:30:00 AM UTC gpg: using RSA key ABC123DEF4567890 gpg: Good signature from \"Your Name \" 3. Secure communication For secure communication, users can use your public key to send an encrypted message to the email address listed in your security.txt file, which is cryptographically bound to your private key, an encrypted PGP message will look like:\n-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE----- ... -----END PGP MESSAGE----- To decrypt this message using your private key:\nSave the encrypted message: nano message.asc (paste the entire PGP message and save the file, Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X) Decrypt the message: gpg --decrypt message.asc (the PGP-encrypted message includes metadata showing your fingerprint, which it was encrypted to; GPG then scans your keyring to find the matching private key needed to decrypt it) A successful decryption will look like: gpg: encrypted with rsa4096 key, ID ABCD1234.... This is the decrypted message content. NOTE: While it is a good practice to become familiar with gpg commands, I have developed a bash script that streamlines encryption, decryption, signing, and signature verification. It works seamlessly as long as GnuPG is installed on your system, available here on my GitHub repository. I have also created a separate bash script for managing PGP keys, including key generation, import, and export. You can download it from the same repository here.\nConclusion Adding a signed security.txt file to your webserver is a simple yet powerful way to build trust with security researchers and users. It ensures that the contact information provided is legitimate and hasn’t been tampered with. By following these steps, you create a clear and verifiable point of contact for handling vulnerabilities responsibly.\nReference securitytxt.org security.txt is defined in RFC 9116 Unsigned vs. Signed security.txt file Digital Trust Center (DTC) - about security.txt - Dutch government Digital Trust Center (DTC) - security.txt is mandatory for the Dutch government ",
