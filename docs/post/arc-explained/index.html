This blog post explains the role and benefits of ARC sealing.
ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) is an email authentication protocol that preserves the authentication results of an email as it travels through multiple intermediaries, such as forwarding services.
Using ARC helps organizations handle the complexities of email authentication, especially when emails are forwarded. ARC involves multiple servers working together based on mutual trust.
ARC ensures that legitimate emails are less likely to be marked as spam or rejected, while fraudulent emails are more easily identified and filtered out. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of ARC, how it works, and the benefits it provides.">

ARC involves multiple servers working together based on mutual trust.\nARC ensures that legitimate emails are less likely to be marked as spam or rejected, while fraudulent emails are more easily identified and filtered out. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of ARC, how it works, and the benefits it provides.\nHow ARC works ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) sealing is a way to help ensure the authenticity of email messages as they pass through various email servers.\nWhen you send an email message, it goes through your sending server and may be routed through an intermediate server (mailing lists or account forwarding services) before it reaches the receiving server. However, some legitimate mail services may modify messages before they’re delivered to the receiving server. Modifying incoming messages in transit can, and likely will, cause the following email authentication failures:\nSPF fails because of the new message source (IP address) SPF checks email messages against an authorized list of IP addresses. When email is forwarded, it passes through an intermediate server whose IP may not be on the sender’s SPF list. This results in unwanted SPF failures, even for legitimate email. DKIM fails because of content modification DKIM adds digital signatures to your emails that can be encrypted using a public key to verify the source and authenticity of the message. To do this, DKIM uses a hash value generated from the email header and body. However, during email forwarding scenarios, additional elements such as custom footers or extended subject lines may be added to the email, which can invalidate DKIM. DMARC fails because of the SPF and DKIM failures DMARC assumes that emails are completely unchanged throughout the delivery process. Want to learn more about SPF, DKIM, and DMARC? You can read my previous blog post about these outbound authentication protocols.\nARC Headers ARC helps preserve email authentication results and verifies the identity of intermediate server(s) that forward a message on to its final destination. There are three key components to ARC:\nThe ARC-Authentication-Results header: A header containing email authentication results like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.\nThe ARC-Message-Signature header: This header takes a snapshot of the message header information, including To, From, Subject, and Body.\nThe ARC-Seal header: This header includes the ARC-Message-Signature and ARC-Authentication-Results header information and contains a tag called chain validation cv=, which contains the result of the evaluation of the existing ARC chain. The value can be none, fail or pass.\nnone: No ARC chain to validate fail: ARC chain validation failed pass: ARC chain validation succeeded Mailbox providers that support ARC Sealers ARC has already been adopted by major mailbox providers such as Google and Microsoft, and is likely to become a global standard.\nSet ARC seals on your intermediate server The commercial MTAs Halon and MailerQ include ARC sealing. For open source solutions, authentication_milter or OpenARC can be used to implement ARC with the Postfix, Oracle Communications Messaging Server, and Sendmail MTAs.\nAccept trusted ARC sealers on your receiving server An intermediate server’s ARC seal can be accepted by an administrator within their mailbox provider (receiving server). To do this, you need to add the trusted signing domain. This domain must match the domain that’s shown in the d value in the ARC-Seal and ARC-Message-Signature headers in affected messages.\nThe steps to accept an ARC seal depend on your mailbox provider; for Microsoft 365, you can use this documentation.\nTo summarize ARC ensures that email authentication results are preserved as messages pass through multiple hops, such as forwarding services and other intermediate services. The success of ARC really depends on email receivers trusting each other by applying the protocol.\nReference ARC Specifications ARC is defined in RFC 8617 Microsoft Defender for Office 365: Configure trusted ARC sealers ",
