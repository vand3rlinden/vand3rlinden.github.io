SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are critical email authentication protocols that help prevent email spoofing, phishing attacks, and domain impersonation for outbound email. Enabling these protocols together strengthens your domain’s email authentication mechanisms, improves security, and builds trust with your recipients by ensuring that email sent from your domain is legitimate and trustworthy.\nSPF, DKIM and DMARC - Comparison table: Protocol Purpose SPF Verifies sender authorization by checking the sender’s IP address DKIM Confirms message authenticity through cryptographic signature matching DMARC Enforces a policy by requiring alignment between SPF and/or DKIM P1 vs. P2 - Sender explanation table: In this blog, you will read a lot about the P1 and P2 sender. Please refer to the table below to become familiar with these terms.\nPostal Letter Precise Term Protected by Sender on envelope (Envelope sender) RFC5321.MailFrom (P1 Sender) SPF Author on letter (Header sender) RFC5322.From (P2 Sender) DKIM + DMARC SPF What is SPF Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a protocol that aims to reduce spam. SPF can reduce email spoofing and spam by determining if the sender is authorized to send on behalf of the listed sender.\nHow SPF works Imagine that you have an SPF record that looks like:\nv=spf1 ip4:11.222.33.444 include:_spf.domain.com -all\nIf an unauthorized server sends on behalf of your domain, the email will get a spf=fail in the message header because the IP is not listed in your SPF record.\nSPF will pass if the sender’s IP is added to the SPF record for the P1 Sender domain.\nImplementation of SPF When you add your domain to Microsoft 365, Microsoft will ask you to provide an SPF record, such as v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all. If you have more allowed senders, you must include them in the SPF record. For example v=spf1 ip4:11.222.33.444 include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:_spf.domain.com -all\nThe SPF record will vary for each domain; therefore, it is important to understand the following when implementing an SPF record:\nCan only have 255 characters, but it can be split to multiple strings in a single record, most DNS providers handle this automatically. Example: \"v=spf1 first string\" \"second string -all\" Can take up to a maximum of 10 DNS Lookups, such as include:spf.protection.outlook.com (this entry costs 1 DNS lookup, with no additional child lookups). CAUTION: You should take steps to stay well under 10 DNS lookups. Because if a vendor decides to add another DNS lookup within its SPF include (child lookup). Your SPF record will become inaccurate because it has reached the DNS lookup limit, which may result in email delivery problems.\nTips to avoid reaching the 10 DNS lookups limit Flatten your SPF record. Example: v=spf1 include:spf.domain.com -all can be v=spf1 ip4:11.222.33.444 ip4:11.222.33.444 -all Not recommended: The problem with flattening is that email service providers can change or add IP addresses without telling you. Then your SPF record will be inaccurate, leading to email delivery problems.\nWhere email is incapable of passing DMARC with SPF (e.g. due to relaying), configure DKIM for the P2 Sender domain on the sending server or email provider. In this scenario, you must to set your SPF record to softfail ~all. This ensures that DKIM evaluation is always performed in the absence of a valid SPF validation, so the email can still be DMARC compliant due to DKIM alignment. Not recommended: You should work toward having both SPF and DKIM properly aligned. However, in relay scenarios, this is not always possible, even for DKIM. In such cases, you can check if your email provider supports ARC Sealers, which help preserve authentication results when an email passes through multiple servers. This allows your recipients to accept the ARC Seal from your relaying or intermediate server. More information about ARC Sealers can be found in this blog.\nAllow SPF to pass by using a different P1 sender, such as your email provider’s domain (if supported), and use DKIM on your own domain as the P2 sender. This method still DMARC compliant because DKIM is aligned with the P2 sender domain. Not recommended: It is not best practice to rely only on DKIM validation. If DKIM fails, for example due to slow DNS response, there is no fallback. The best practice is to have both SPF and DKIM correctly aligned.\nNot using entries like a and mx, these mechanisms are often useless and probably should not be included in your SPF record (and other duplicate SPF mechanisms).\nMove to vendor traffic with the use of subdomains for SPF authentication, subdomain segmentation creates a new domain dedicated to a particular email provider with its own 10 DNS lookups. Organizations that segment their email providers find there is no need for SPF flattening and will end up with better controls, less attack surface, and limit any spillover effects of a potential cyber incident.\nSubdomain segmentation can be implemented in three ways: Using a direct subdomain addresses. Check if your email providers have the ability to pass SPF on a subdomain on behalf of your primary domain; passing SPF on a subdomain is still DMARC compliant (assuming your DMARC policy uses the default aspf=r tag for SPF relaxed mode). Use an SPF macro to limit a third-party service to sending from a specific address, since services like Salesforce are most often limited to sending from a single email address, such as invoices@yourdomain.com. Softfail or Hardfail SPF can get a softfail or a hardfail, you determine that at the end of the record.\nWith ~all: The SPF record identifies the host as NOT authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain; however, it instructs email receivers to accept the email but flag it as potentially suspicious.\nWith -all: The SPF record specifies that the host is NOT authorized to send emails and instructs email receivers to reject them.\nMost mailbox providers will treat soft and hard- fails directives similarly, but it is recommended to mirror the DMARC policy as the technology is deployed: use softfail (~all) if the DMARC policies are “none” and “quarantine”, and use hardfail (-all) if you have moved to a “reject” policy.\nNOTE: If an email cannot pass SPF (e.g. due to relaying), it can be hard rejected at the SMTP level with an SPF hardfail (-all), which may prevent DKIM evaluation from being performed on the receiving mail server, which can then lead to a DMARC failure. If you are unsure whether your senders are passing SPF, then consider using an SPF softfail (~all) along with DMARC set to reject (p=reject). This ensures that DKIM evaluation is always performed in the absence of a valid SPF validation, so the email can still be DMARC compliant due to DKIM alignment.\nLimitations of SPF Although SPF performs reasonably well in theory, it has several limitations that make it insufficient on its own to fully protect a sending domain.\nSPF only validates the P1 sender, not the P2 sender. To address this gap, DKIM was introduced. DKIM helps protect the P2 sender by attaching a cryptographic signature to the message, allowing the receiving mail server to verify its authenticity by matching the private key used to sign the message with the public key published in DNS. However, not all sending mail servers had support to add DKIM signatures. This limitation led to the development of DMARC. DMARC allows domain owners to publish policies specifying how to handle messages that fail SPF and/or DKIM checks, particularly when the P1 and P2 identities are not aligned. Acting as the final layer of defense, DMARC ensures protection for the P2 sender by enforcing alignment and providing clear instructions for handling authentication failures.\nDKIM What is DKIM DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an authentication-based technique that allows the receiving mail server to verify the authenticity of an email by comparing the received private key with the public key if they match.\nHow DKIM works The receiving server makes a DNS request using the sender’s domain name (P2 Sender). In response to the DNS request, the receiving server obtains the public key from a DNS record in the DNS zone of the sending domain, such as selector1._domainkey.yourdomain.com, and compares it to the private key in the message from the sending server.\nDKIM will pass if the sending server’s private key can be confirmed by the receiving server, using the public key in the sending domain’s DNS zone. This public key is published in a TXT or within a CNAME record. For example, if in TXT:\nHostname: key1._domainkey.yourdomain.com (in TXT) Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9….; (public key) Implementation of DKIM You can configure DKIM with a TXT record in your DNS zone for your sending mail servers (such as postfix or sendmail). A DKIM generator can be used to generate a private key for your server and a public key for your DNS.\nNOTE: A DKIM record is required for each sending server or mail provider.\nHow you set up DKIM depends on your sending server or mail provider. For example, configuring DKIM for Salesforce differs from Exchange Online in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. If you’re managing your own mail server and using MTAs like Sendmail or Postfix, you can implement DKIM using tools such as OpenDKIM.\nDKIM recommendations You must implement DKIM key rotation for each sending server or mail provider to prevent adversaries from intercepting and decrypting your DKIM keys. DKIM Key rotation helps to minimize the risk of having a private key compromised. Recurring: Every six months for a 2048-bit DKIM key. The DKIM key length must be at least 2048-bits. DMARC What is DMARC DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) acts as a shield on top of SPF and DKIM. With DMARC, domain owners specify how to handle emails sent on behalf of their domain if those messages fail SPF and/or DKIM checks. This allows them to define whether such emails should be monitored, quarantined, or rejected entirely.\nHow DMARC works Once your domain has a DMARC record, any receiving email server can verify the incoming email based on the instructions in the DMARC policy. If the email passes the DMARC authentication, it will be delivered and can be trusted. If the email fails the check, depending on the instructions in the DMARC record, the email can be delivered, quarantined (flagged as potentially suspicious), or rejected.\nDMARC will pass if the P1 Sender and P2 Sender are equal, and/or SPF and DKIM are passed. If the P1 sender is not equal to the P2 sender, then DKIM must pass for the P2 sender domain in order to get a DMARC pass.\nImplementation of DMARC Before enforcing a DMARC policy, it’s important to understand how often DMARC checks might fail for your domain. Jumping straight to a reject policy without visibility can cause legitimate email to be blocked.\nYou should start by monitoring DMARC failures. This can be done in two ways:\nManually reviewing DMARC RUA reports to identify which email providers are passing or failing DMARC. However, for high-volume domains, this can be overwhelming and difficult to manage. RUA report example in .xml:\nUsing DMARC monitoring tools allows you to convert RUA reports into clear visual dashboards, providing more actionable insights than raw IP address data alone. Most tools can associate sending IP addresses with known email providers, such as Microsoft 365 or Salesforce. One example of such a tool is Valimail (free for Microsoft 365 users with an Exchange Online plan). For personal use, you can use Mailhardener’s free version, which supports one domain and offers one month of data retention. Overview of the Valimail Dashboard:\nTo sign up for a free Valimail environment, click here. Once the setup is complete, you can sign in at app.valimail.com. After logging in, you can proceed to integrate Microsoft Entra ID SSO with Valimail.\nFor heavy mail domains, I recommended monitoring the domain for at least three months with the DMARC policy set to none:\nHostname: _dmarc Value: v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; rua=mailto:dmarc_agg@vali.email; During the monitoring phase, you can adjust your SPF record and set up DKIM for each sending server, and then update your DMARC record to reject once the monitoring phase is complete:\nValue: v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_agg@vali.email; The sp=reject tag means that subdomains will be included; if you don’t want your subdomains to be included in your domain’s root DMARC policy, you can set this to sp=none and list a separate DMARC policy for each subdomain (not recommended).\nNOTE: If you do not list the sp= tag, your subdomains will get the policy from the p= tag.\nClarification on DMARC Monitoring DMARC monitoring does not provide insights into the total sending volume of your domain. Instead, it only shows authentication results (SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass or fail) based on the aggregate (RUA) reports received.\nThere are three primary approaches to managing reporting in your DMARC monitoring strategy:\nIf you see an email provider you don’t recognize, but SPF and/or DKIM passes, and your organization hasn’t historically documented all authorized email providers, review your SPF and *._domainkey entries in your public DNS. Remove any unused entries, and establish a practice of documenting all email providers authorized to send on behalf of your domain. If you recognize an email provider, but SPF and/or DKIM fails, update your domain’s email authentication settings to align SPF and DKIM for that email provider. This ensures the email provider is properly configured for outbound email authentication. If the email provider is unrecognized and all authentication checks fail (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC), then DMARC is working as intended. No action is required, as these messages will be rejected by most receiving mail servers once your DMARC policy is set to reject. Maintenance steps on DMARC Monitoring SPF:\nPerform periodic checks of the SPF record Track and document any changes to the SPF record Maintain an up-to-date list of authorized senders DKIM:\nMonitor for periodic DKIM key rotations Recurring: Every six months for a 2048-bit DKIM key Ensure timely updates and reconfiguration of rotated keys DMARC:\nRegularly review DMARC reports and data Set up alerting and reporting to detect high-volume email sources where DMARC validation fails due to SPF or DKIM misalignment DMARC policy explanation Policy Value Meaning None p=none; This policy is essentially a monitoring or reporting mode. It instructs email receivers not to take any action based on the DMARC authentication results. Quarantine p=quarantine; This policy instructs email receivers to mark emails that fail DMARC authentication as potentially suspicious, typically delivering them to the recipient’s SPAM folder. As a result, the DMARC quarantine policy does not fully utilize the protective capabilities of DMARC. Reject p=reject; This policy instructs email receivers to reject (not deliver) emails that fail DMARC authentication. The table on this Microsoft Learn page summarizes the options you have when configuring your DMARC policy.\nRUA vs. RUF DMARC Reports RUA (Reporting URI for Aggregate reports):\nIs designed to send domain owners data about email authentication results for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC. These reports are essential for monitoring how a domain is being used and contain only authentication outcomes and message counts, without including any sensitive email content. Combined data on a group of emails Not real-time, they are sent everyday by default Sent in XML format No PII (Personal Identifiable Information) Supported in all DMARC-compliant mailbox providers RUF (Reporting URI for Forensic reports):\nIs designed to send domain owners detailed failure reports when emails don’t pass DMARC checks. These reports may include portions of the original message headers and metadata, sometimes with limited message content, depending on the reporting provider. The goal is to help identify legitimate sources that need to be properly authenticated. However, due to privacy concerns and the potential exposure of Personal Identifiable Information (PII), most providers do not send RUF reports. Details of an individual email Sent almost immediately after the failures Plain text format Contains PII (Personal Identifiable Information) Supported in only a handful of mailbox providers, due to the sensitive PII data it may contains Best Practices and Insights for RUA and RUF DMARC Reports You don’t need RUF Reporting to get a DMARC compliant domain, RUA is sufficient.\nNot all receiving mail servers support sending both RUF and RUA reports. Most servers typically support RUA, but this is not guaranteed. If supported, the reports are sent to the addresses specified in the DMARC policy.\nIt’s not prohibited to include multiple email addresses in the RUA and RUF tags. However, best practice recommends limiting each tag to no more than two addresses, as some providers may ignore additional entries when sending DMARC reports. My advice is to limit this to one address whenever possible. If you do need to include more than one, you should format it like this: rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com,mailto:dmarc@example.com;\nDMARC External Validation for RUA/RUF: If you want to send DMARC reports to a domain different from your own, the receiving domain must explicitly authorize this by configuring a DNS record. This ensures that email providers recognize the recipient as an authorized destination for the reports.\nFor example, if you’re sending reports to example.com, that domain must create the following TXT record: yourdomain.com._report._dmarc.example.com, with the value: v=DMARC1; DMARC monitoring providers, like Valimail, handle this automatically or use wildcard records on their end. Protect all non-sending domains To protect all non-sending domains, you should consider:\nA deny all SPF record: Name: @ Content:v=spf1 -all Type: TXT A reject DMARC record: Name: _dmarc Content: v=DMARC1; p=reject; Type: TXT An unassociated public key as a DKIM wildcard record: Name: *._domainkey Content: v=DKIM1; p= Type: TXT This protects all of your domains from phishers and spammers, as bad actors will actively look for unused domains to exploit.\nTo Summarize SPF: performs verification that the IP address of the sending server matches the entry in the SPF record from the sending domain.\nPurpose: Sender authorization check Protect: RFC5321.MailFrom (P1 Sender) DKIM: verifies if the public key (DNS record) of a sending domain, matched the private key that came from the sending server. This is a check that the sending domain actually sent the e-mail. DKIM must be configured for each sending server, such as Exchange Online or any other email provider.\nPurpose: Message authenticity verification Protect: RFC5322.From (P2 Sender) DMARC: ensures that emails that fail the SPF and/or DKIM tests do not get through. If the email is unable to pass DMARC with SPF, DKIM can help pass DMARC for the P2 sender domain. Therefore, it is really important to have DKIM enabled for all your sending servers before setting DMARC to reject.\nPurpose: Final sheld on top of SPF and DKIM Protect: RFC5322.From (P2 Sender) Reference Dmarcian SPF best practices - Unavailable from the Netherlands Dmarcian Concluding the Experiment: SPF Flattening - Unavailable from the Netherlands Dmarcian DMARC best practices - Unavailable from the Netherlands Dmarcian The Difference in DMARC Reports: RUA and RUF - Unavailable from the Netherlands Why Mailhardener recommends SPF softfail over fail How to protect domains that do not send email SPF is defined in RFC 7208 DKIM is defined in RFC 6376 DMARC is defined in RFC 7489 SPF Policy Tester ",

<p>SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are critical email authentication protocols that help prevent email spoofing, phishing attacks, and domain impersonation for <em><strong>outbound email</strong></em>. Enabling these protocols together strengthens your domain&rsquo;s email authentication mechanisms, improves security, and builds trust with your recipients by ensuring that email sent from your domain is legitimate and trustworthy.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-spf">What is SPF<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-spf">#</a></h3>
<p>Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is a protocol that aims to reduce spam. SPF can reduce email spoofing and spam by determining if the sender is authorized to send on behalf of the listed sender.</p>
<h3 id="how-spf-works">How SPF works<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-spf-works">#</a></h3>
<p>Imagine that you have an SPF record that looks like:</p>
<p><code>v=spf1 ip4:11.222.33.444 include:_spf.domain.com -all</code></p>
<p>If an unauthorized server sends on behalf of your domain, the email will get a <code>spf=fail</code> in the message header because the IP is not listed in your SPF record.</p>
<p>SPF will pass if the sender’s IP is added to the SPF record for the P1 Sender domain.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-of-spf">Implementation of SPF<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implementation-of-spf">#</a></h3>
<p>When you add your domain to Microsoft 365, Microsoft will ask you to provide an SPF record, such as <code>v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</code>. If you have more allowed senders, you must include them in the SPF record. For example <code>v=spf1 ip4:11.222.33.444 include:spf.protection.outlook.com include:_spf.domain.com -all</code></p>
<p>The SPF record will vary for each domain; therefore, it is important to understand the following when implementing an SPF record:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can only have 255 characters, but it can be split to multiple strings in a single record, most DNS providers handle this automatically.
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>&quot;v=spf1 first string&quot; &quot;second string -all&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can take up to a maximum of 10 DNS Lookups, such as <code>include:spf.protection.outlook.com</code> (this entry costs 1 DNS lookup, with no additional child lookups).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>: You should take <a href="https://vand3rlinden.com/post/handle-your-spf-record/">steps</a> to stay well under 10 DNS lookups. Because if a vendor decides to add another DNS lookup within its SPF include (child lookup). Your SPF record will become inaccurate because it has reached the DNS lookup limit, which may result in email delivery problems.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="tips-to-avoid-reaching-the-10-dns-lookups-limit">Tips to avoid reaching the 10 DNS lookups limit<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tips-to-avoid-reaching-the-10-dns-lookups-limit">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Flatten your SPF record.
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>v=spf1 include:spf.domain.com -all</code> can be <code>v=spf1 ip4:11.222.33.444 ip4:11.222.33.444 -all</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not recommended</strong>: The <a href="https://vand3rlinden.com/post/handle-your-spf-record/#the-dangers-of-spf-flattening">problem with flattening</a> is that email service providers can change or add IP addresses without telling you. Then your SPF record will be inaccurate, leading to email delivery problems.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Where email is incapable of passing DMARC with SPF (e.g. due to relaying), configure DKIM for the P2 Sender domain on the sending server or email provider.
<ul>
<li>In this scenario, you must to set your SPF record to <a href="https://vand3rlinden.com/post/spf-dkim-dmarc-explanation/#softfail-or-hardfail">softfail</a> <code>~all</code>. This ensures that DKIM evaluation is always performed in the absence of a valid SPF validation, so the email can still be DMARC compliant due to DKIM alignment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not recommended</strong>: You should work toward having both SPF and DKIM properly aligned. However, in relay scenarios, this is not always possible, even for DKIM. In such cases, you can check if your email provider supports ARC Sealers, which help preserve authentication results when an email passes through multiple servers. This allows your recipients to accept the ARC Seal from your relaying or intermediate server. More information about ARC Sealers can be found in <a href="https://vand3rlinden.com/post/arc-explained/">this</a> blog.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Allow SPF to pass by using a different P1 sender, such as your email provider’s domain (if supported), and use DKIM on your own domain as the P2 sender. This method still DMARC compliant because DKIM is aligned with the P2 sender domain.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Not recommended</strong>: It is not best practice to rely only on DKIM validation. If DKIM fails, for example due to slow DNS response, there is no fallback. The best practice is to have both SPF and DKIM correctly aligned.</p></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not using entries like <code>a</code> and <code>mx</code>, these mechanisms are often useless and probably should not be included in your SPF record (and other duplicate SPF mechanisms).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move to vendor traffic with the use of subdomains for SPF authentication, subdomain segmentation creates a new domain dedicated to a particular email provider with its own 10 DNS lookups. Organizations that segment their email providers find there is no need for SPF flattening and will end up with better controls, less attack surface, and limit any spillover effects of a potential cyber incident.</p>
<ul>
<li>Subdomain segmentation can be implemented in three ways:
<ul>
<li>Using a direct subdomain addresses.</li>
<li>Check if your email providers have the ability to pass SPF on a subdomain on behalf of your primary domain; passing SPF on a subdomain is still DMARC compliant (assuming your DMARC policy uses the default <code>aspf=r</code> tag for SPF relaxed mode).</li>
<li>Use an <a href="https://vand3rlinden.com/post/handle-your-spf-record/#use-an-spf-macro-to-restrict-a-third-party-service-to-send-from-a-specific-address">SPF macro</a> to limit a third-party service to sending from a specific address, since services like Salesforce are most often limited to sending from a single email address, such as <code>invoices@yourdomain.com</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="softfail-or-hardfail">Softfail or Hardfail<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#softfail-or-hardfail">#</a></h3>
<p>SPF can get a softfail or a hardfail, you determine that at the end of the record.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With <code>~all</code>: The SPF record identifies the host as NOT authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain; however, it instructs email receivers to accept the email but flag it as potentially suspicious.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With <code>-all</code>: The SPF record specifies that the host is NOT authorized to send emails and instructs email receivers to reject them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most mailbox providers will treat soft and hard- fails directives similarly, but it is <a href="https://dmarcian.com/spf-best-practices/">recommended</a> to mirror the DMARC policy as the technology is deployed: use softfail (<code>~all</code>) if the DMARC policies are &ldquo;none&rdquo; and &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo;, and use hardfail (<code>-all</code>) if you have moved to a &ldquo;reject&rdquo; policy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If an email cannot pass SPF (e.g. due to relaying), it can be hard rejected at the SMTP level with an SPF hardfail (<code>-all</code>), which may prevent DKIM evaluation from being performed on the receiving mail server, which can then lead to a DMARC failure. If you are unsure whether your senders are passing SPF, then <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/blog/why-mailhardener-recommends-spf-softfail-over-fail">consider using an SPF softfail (<code>~all</code>)</a> along with DMARC set to reject (<code>p=reject</code>). This ensures that DKIM evaluation is always performed in the absence of a valid SPF validation, so the email can still be DMARC compliant due to DKIM alignment.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="limitations-of-spf">Limitations of SPF<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#limitations-of-spf">#</a></h3>
<p>Although SPF performs reasonably well in theory, it has several limitations that make it insufficient on its own to fully protect a sending domain.</p>
<p>SPF only validates the P1 sender, not the P2 sender. To address this gap, DKIM was introduced. DKIM helps protect the P2 sender by attaching a cryptographic signature to the message, allowing the receiving mail server to verify its authenticity by matching the private key used to sign the message with the public key published in DNS. However, not all sending mail servers had support to add DKIM signatures. This limitation led to the development of DMARC. DMARC allows domain owners to publish policies specifying how to handle messages that fail SPF and/or DKIM checks, particularly when the P1 and P2 identities are not aligned. Acting as the final layer of defense, DMARC ensures protection for the P2 sender by enforcing alignment and providing clear instructions for handling authentication failures.</p>
<h2 id="dkim">DKIM<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dkim">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-is-dkim">What is DKIM<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-dkim">#</a></h3>
<p>DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is an authentication-based technique that allows the receiving mail server to verify the authenticity of an email by comparing the received private key with the public key if they match.</p>
<h3 id="how-dkim-works">How DKIM works<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-dkim-works">#</a></h3>
<p>The receiving server makes a DNS request using the sender’s domain name (P2 Sender). In response to the DNS request, the receiving server obtains the public key from a DNS record in the DNS zone of the sending domain, such as <code>selector1._domainkey.yourdomain.com</code>, and compares it to the private key in the message from the sending server.</p>
<p>DKIM will pass if the sending server’s private key can be confirmed by the receiving server, using the public key in the sending domain’s DNS zone. This public key is published in a <code>TXT</code> or within a <code>CNAME</code> record. For example, if in <code>TXT</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostname: <code>key1._domainkey.yourdomain.com</code> (in <code>TXT</code>)</li>
<li>Value: <code>v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9….;</code> (public key)</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="IMAGE" loading="lazy" src="/images/spf-dkim-dmarc-explanation/dkim-visual.png"></p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-dkim">Implementation of DKIM<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implementation-of-dkim">#</a></h3>
<p>You can configure DKIM with a <code>TXT</code> record in your DNS zone for your sending mail servers (such as postfix or sendmail). A DKIM generator can be used to generate a private key for your server and a public key for your DNS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A DKIM record is required for each sending server or mail provider.</p></blockquote>
<p>How you set up DKIM depends on your sending server or mail provider. For example, configuring DKIM for <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sales.emailadmin_create_secure_dkim.htm">Salesforce</a> differs from <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/email-authentication-dkim-configure">Exchange Online</a> in Microsoft Defender for Office 365. If you’re managing your own mail server and using MTAs like Sendmail or Postfix, you can implement DKIM using tools such as <a href="http://www.opendkim.org/">OpenDKIM</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dkim-recommendations">DKIM recommendations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dkim-recommendations">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>You must implement DKIM key rotation for each sending server or mail provider to prevent adversaries from intercepting and decrypting your DKIM keys. DKIM Key rotation helps to minimize the risk of having a private key compromised.
<ul>
<li>Recurring: Every six months for a 2048-bit DKIM key.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The DKIM key length must be at least 2048-bits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dmarc">DMARC<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dmarc">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="what-is-dmarc">What is DMARC<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-is-dmarc">#</a></h3>
<p>DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) acts as a shield on top of SPF and DKIM. With DMARC, domain owners specify how to handle emails sent on behalf of their domain if those messages fail SPF and/or DKIM checks. This allows them to define whether such emails should be monitored, quarantined, or rejected entirely.</p>
<h3 id="how-dmarc-works">How DMARC works<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-dmarc-works">#</a></h3>
<p>Once your domain has a DMARC record, any receiving email server can verify the incoming email based on the instructions in the DMARC policy. If the email passes the DMARC authentication, it will be delivered and can be trusted. If the email fails the check, depending on the instructions in the DMARC record, the email can be delivered, quarantined (flagged as potentially suspicious), or rejected.</p>
<p>DMARC will pass if the P1 Sender and P2 Sender are equal, and/or SPF and DKIM are passed. If the P1 sender is not equal to the P2 sender, then DKIM must pass for the P2 sender domain in order to get a DMARC pass.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-of-dmarc">Implementation of DMARC<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#implementation-of-dmarc">#</a></h3>
<p>Before enforcing a DMARC policy, it’s important to understand how often DMARC checks might fail for your domain. Jumping straight to a reject policy without visibility can cause legitimate email to be blocked.</p>
<p>You should start by monitoring DMARC failures. This can be done in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manually reviewing DMARC <code>RUA</code> reports to identify which email providers are passing or failing DMARC. However, for high-volume domains, this can be overwhelming and difficult to manage.</li>
</ol>
<p>RUA report example in <code>.xml</code>:</p>
<p><img alt="IMAGE" loading="lazy" src="/images/spf-dkim-dmarc-explanation/dmarc-xml.png"></p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Using DMARC monitoring tools allows you to convert <code>RUA</code> reports into clear visual dashboards, providing more actionable insights than raw IP address data alone. Most tools can associate sending IP addresses with known email providers, such as Microsoft 365 or Salesforce. One example of such a tool is <a href="https://www.valimail.com/blog/office-365-free-dmarc-monitoring/">Valimail</a> (free for Microsoft 365 users with an Exchange Online plan). For personal use, you can use <a href="https://www.mailhardener.com/pricing">Mailhardener’s free version</a>, which supports one domain and offers one month of data retention.</li>

<p>For heavy mail domains, I recommended monitoring the domain for at least three months with the DMARC policy set to <code>none</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hostname: <code>_dmarc</code></li>
<li>Value: <code>v=DMARC1; p=none; sp=none; rua=mailto:dmarc_agg@vali.email;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>During the monitoring phase, you can <a href="https://vand3rlinden.com/post/handle-your-spf-record/">adjust your SPF record</a> and <a href="https://vand3rlinden.com/post/spf-dkim-dmarc-explanation/#implementation-of-dkim">set up DKIM for each sending server</a>, and then update your DMARC record to <code>reject</code> once the monitoring phase is complete:</p>
<ul>
<li>Value: <code>v=DMARC1; p=reject; sp=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc_agg@vali.email;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>sp=reject</code> tag means that subdomains will be included; if you don’t want your subdomains to be included in your domain’s root DMARC policy, you can set this to <code>sp=none</code> and list a separate DMARC policy for each subdomain (not recommended).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you do not list the <code>sp=</code> tag, your subdomains will get the policy from the <code>p=</code> tag.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="clarification-on-dmarc-monitoring">Clarification on DMARC Monitoring<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#clarification-on-dmarc-monitoring">#</a></h3>
<p>DMARC monitoring does <strong>not</strong> provide insights into the total sending volume of your domain. Instead, it <strong>only</strong> shows authentication results (SPF/DKIM/DMARC pass or fail) based on the aggregate (<code>RUA</code>) reports received.</p>
<p>There are three primary approaches to managing reporting in your DMARC monitoring strategy:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you see an email provider you don’t recognize, but SPF and/or DKIM passes, and your organization hasn’t historically documented all authorized email providers, review your SPF and <code>*._domainkey</code> entries in your public DNS. Remove any unused entries, and establish a practice of documenting all email providers authorized to send on behalf of your domain.</li>
<li>If you recognize an email provider, but SPF and/or DKIM fails, update your domain’s email authentication settings to align SPF and DKIM for that email provider. This ensures the email provider is properly configured for outbound email authentication.</li>
<li>If the email provider is unrecognized and all authentication checks fail (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC), then DMARC is working as intended. No action is required, as these messages will be rejected by most receiving mail servers once your DMARC policy is set to <code>reject</code>.</li>

<ol>
<li>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need <code>RUF</code> Reporting to get a DMARC compliant domain, <code>RUA</code> is sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all receiving mail servers support sending both <code>RUF</code> and <code>RUA</code> reports. Most servers typically support <code>RUA</code>, but this is not guaranteed. If supported, the reports are sent to the addresses specified in the DMARC policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It’s not prohibited to include multiple email addresses in the <code>RUA</code> and <code>RUF</code> tags. However, best practice recommends limiting each tag to no more than two addresses, as some providers may ignore additional entries when sending DMARC reports. <strong>My advice</strong> is to limit this to one address whenever possible. If you do need to include more than one, you should format it like this: <code>rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com,mailto:dmarc@example.com;</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DMARC External Validation for <code>RUA</code>/<code>RUF</code>: If you want to send DMARC reports to a domain different from your own, the receiving domain must explicitly authorize this by configuring a DNS record. This ensures that email providers recognize the recipient as an authorized destination for the reports.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if you’re sending reports to <code>example.com</code>, that domain must create the following TXT record: <code>yourdomain.com._report._dmarc.example.com</code>, with the value: <code>v=DMARC1;</code></li>
<li>DMARC monitoring providers, like Valimail, handle this automatically or use wildcard records on their end.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>To protect all non-sending domains, you should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <em><strong>deny all SPF</strong></em> record:
<ul>
<li>Name: <code>@</code></li>
<li>Content:<code>v=spf1 -all</code></li>
<li>Type: <code>TXT</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <em><strong>reject DMARC</strong></em> record:
<ul>
<li>Name: <code>_dmarc</code></li>
<li>Content: <code>v=DMARC1; p=reject;</code></li>
<li>Type: <code>TXT</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An <em><strong>unassociated public key as a DKIM</strong></em> wildcard record:
<ul>
<li>Name: <code>*._domainkey</code></li>
<li>Content: <code>v=DKIM1; p=</code></li>
<li>Type: <code>TXT</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This protects all of your domains from phishers and spammers, as bad actors will actively look for unused domains to exploit.</p>
<h2 id="to-summarize">To Summarize<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#to-summarize">#</a></h2>
<p><strong>SPF</strong>: performs verification that the IP address of the sending server matches the entry in the SPF record from the sending domain.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Sender authorization check</li>
<li><strong>Protect</strong>: <code>RFC5321.MailFrom</code> (P1 Sender)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DKIM</strong>: verifies if the public key (DNS record) of a sending domain, matched the private key that came from the sending server. This is a check that the sending domain actually sent the e-mail. DKIM must be configured for <strong>each</strong> sending server, such as Exchange Online or any other email provider.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Message authenticity verification</li>
<li><strong>Protect</strong>: <code>RFC5322.From</code> (P2 Sender)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>DMARC</strong>: ensures that emails that fail the SPF and/or DKIM tests do not get through. If the email is unable to pass DMARC with SPF, DKIM can help pass DMARC for the P2 sender domain. Therefore, it is really important to have DKIM enabled for all your sending servers before setting DMARC to <code>reject</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Final sheld on top of SPF and DKIM</li>
<li><strong>Protect</strong>: <code>RFC5322.From</code> (P2 Sender)</li>
