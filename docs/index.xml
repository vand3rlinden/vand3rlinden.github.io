      <description>This blog post explains how an MTA STS policy works and how to implement it on GitHub Pages.
MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is a security protocol designed to improve the security of email communication by enforcing the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt email traffic between mail servers. It helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and downgrade attacks, where an attacker could intercept or tamper with email messages in transit.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role and Benefits of ARC Sealing</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/arc-explained/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 23:37:34 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/arc-explained/</guid>
      <description>This blog post explains the role and benefits of ARC sealing.
ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) is an email authentication protocol that preserves the authentication results of an email as it travels through multiple intermediaries, such as forwarding services.
By using ARC, organizations can better manage the complexities of email authentication, especially when email is forwarded, but ARC is a collaboration of multiple servers that trust each other.
ARC ensures that legitimate emails are less likely to be marked as spam or rejected, while fraudulent emails are more easily identified and filtered out.</description>

Fine-tune DKIM by frequently rotating the DKIM keys After setting up DKIM in Microsoft Defender for Office 365, it is also important to set up frequent rotation of these DKIM keys to prevent adversaries from intercepting and decrypting your cryptographic keys. Key rotation helps to minimize the risk of compromising the private keys. In Microsoft 365, you can rotate the DKIM keys for your domains to increase security.</description>

      <description>In this post, you find out how DNSSEC and DANE cooperate, and learn how to set up DANE TLSA DNS records.
DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) The domain name system (DNS) is the phone book of the Internet: it tells computers where to send and retrieve information. Unfortunately, it also accepts any address given to it, no questions asked.
DNSSEC adds a security layer to this phonebook. It uses digital signatures to make sure the information in the phonebook can be trusted and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with.</description>

      <description>In this post, I will share my best practices for getting a handle on your SPF record.
Why it makes sense to have a good SPF procedure in place In a previous blog post, I explained the limitations of SPF and how it works with DKIM and DMARC.

      <title>Microsoft Purview: Configuring a Data Loss Prevention Policy</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/purview-data-loss-prevention/</link>

      <guid>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/purview-data-loss-prevention/</guid>
      <description>Organizations have sensitive information under their control, such as credit card numbers or social security numbers. To protect this sensitive information and reduce risk, organizations need a way to prevent users from sharing it with people who shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have it. This practice is known as data loss prevention (DLP). In this article, I will explain how to configure it.
Sensitive information type entity definitions In this post, I will configure a DLP policy to block the Netherlands Citizen’s Service (BSN) Number from being shared with external contacts in Exchange Online and Teams.</description>

      <description>Quarantine policies let you control the quarantine on how users can use it. This post will cover the default policies and how to create a custom policy.
What are quarantine policies Back in April 2020, Microsoft made it possible for users to view, release, or delete quarantined messages (expect high confidence phishing). Some organizations were not happy about users having access to their own quarantined items. Quarantine policies give you more control over quarantine for your end users and which quarantined items they can release.</description>
