      <title>Exchange Online: Reject Direct Send</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/exo-reject-direct-send/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this post, you will learn what Direct Send is, how attackers can abuse it, and how to block its use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct Send is a method used to send emails directly to Exchange Online hosted mailboxes from on-premises devices, applications, or third-party cloud services, using the MX record endpoint of your accepted domain in Exchange Online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This method assumes that SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are properly configured for your accepted domain. Any sender using Direct Send without being included in the SPF record of the accepted domain will already struggle to deliver messages successfully to your internal inboxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Using PGP for secure email communication</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/pgp-secure-email-communication/</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this post, I will explain what PGP is, how it differs from S/MIME, and why encrypting and signing your emails is more important than ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-pgp&#34;&gt;What is PGP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that offers authentication and cryptographic privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you take precautions, email is still one of the least secure ways to communicate. To keep your correspondence private and impenetrable, PGP provides a strong method for encrypting and signing your emails.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Microsoft 365: Protect your environment against AiTM phishing attacks</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/m365-protect-against-aitm-phishing/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Mar 2025 22:52:19 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/m365-protect-against-aitm-phishing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this blog post, we’ll walk through practical strategies to reduce the likelihood and impact of successful AiTM phishing attacks in Microsoft 365.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s threat landscape, adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attacks have emerged as a particularly dangerous tactic. These attacks bypass traditional defenses by placing a malicious proxy between the user and the legitimate service, capturing credentials and session tokens in real time. Once attackers have session tokens, they can bypass even multi-factor authentication (MFA), making AiTM attacks especially difficult to defend against.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Enhance the visual identity of your email with BIMI</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/bimi-explained/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 19 Oct 2024 23:30:32 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/bimi-explained/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this post, you will learn what BIMI is, how it works, and the benefits it brings to your domain, including increased trust and brand visibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a time where most first impressions happen online, and emails are usually the first touchpoint. The problem is, inboxes are crowded, and getting someone to notice your message isn’t easy. That’s exactly why BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) was created. It gives companies a simple way to show who they are and build trust the moment their email lands.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>MTA-STS Explained: A complete guide to the MTA-STS Policy</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/mta-sts-explained/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 16:22:41 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/mta-sts-explained/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post explains how an MTA-STS policy works and how to implement it on GitHub Pages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MTA-STS is a security mechanism that allows a sending (outbound) mail server to enforce the use of TLS by retrieving a secured &lt;code&gt;HTTPS&lt;/code&gt; policy file published by the domain of the receiving (inbound) mail server. This enforcement ensures that connections between mail servers are encrypted and authenticated, preventing attackers from downgrading the connection or intercepting messages through man in the middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exchange Online: Configure inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/exo-inbound-smtp-dane-dnssec/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 28 Jul 2024 01:13:44 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/exo-inbound-smtp-dane-dnssec/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this post, you will learn how to enable and use SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;outbound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online has been enabled since 2022, Microsoft is has rolling out &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inbound&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online since late 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a deeper understanding of DNSSEC and DANE, take a look at my earlier &lt;a href=&#34;https://vand3rlinden.com/post/dnssec-dane-explained/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-smtp-dane-with-dnssec-works&#34;&gt;How SMTP DANE with DNSSEC works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMTP DANE is a security mechanism that uses DNSSEC to allow a sending (outbound) mail server to verify the TLS certificate of a receiving (inbound) mail server using &lt;code&gt;TLSA&lt;/code&gt; records published in the DNS of the receiving domain. This helps ensure that TLS connections between mail servers cannot be intercepted or downgraded, protecting against attacks such as TLS downgrade and man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding the role and benefits of ARC Sealing</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/arc-explained/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 May 2024 23:37:34 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/arc-explained/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog post explains the role and benefits of ARC sealing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) is an email authentication protocol that preserves the authentication results of an email as it travels through multiple intermediaries, such as forwarding services. This allows your recipients to accept the ARC Seal from your relaying or intermediate server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ARC helps organizations handle the complexities of email authentication, especially when emails are forwarded. ARC involves multiple servers working together based on mutual trust. In this blog post, we will explore the basics of ARC, how it works, and the benefits it provides.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Understanding S/MIME: Enhancing Email Security</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/s-mime-enhancing-email-security/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Apr 2024 17:09:18 +0200</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlocking the Power of S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions): This article will help you understand S/MIME and how to request, configure, and use S/MIME on your devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-smime&#34;&gt;What is S/MIME?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S/MIME is an email security standard that allows messages to be encrypted and digitally signed. Encryption protects the content of emails, so only the intended recipient can read them, while digital signatures verify the sender’s identity and ensure the message has not been altered. When properly implemented, S/MIME helps keep email communications private and secure from unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Get a handle on your SPF record</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/handle-your-spf-record/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 18:31:45 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/handle-your-spf-record/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this post, I will share my best practices for getting a handle on your SPF record.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-it-makes-sense-to-have-a-good-spf-procedure-in-place&#34;&gt;Why it makes sense to have a good SPF procedure in place&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a previous &lt;a href=&#34;https://vand3rlinden.com/post/spf-dkim-dmarc-explanation/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I explained the limitations of SPF and how it works with DKIM and DMARC. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to have a well-structured SPF procedure to avoid future problems, especially since exceeding the DNS lookup limit of 10 can cause issues, such as:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this post you will learn to understand how the DNS protocols SPF, DKIM and DMARC work together to protect your domain from phishers and spammers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-deploy-spf-dkim-and-dmarc&#34;&gt;Why deploy SPF, DKIM, and DMARC?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are critical email authentication protocols that help prevent email spoofing, phishing attacks, and domain impersonation for &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;outbound email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Enabling these protocols together strengthens your domain&amp;rsquo;s email authentication mechanisms, improves security, and builds trust with your recipients by ensuring that email sent from your domain is legitimate and trustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
