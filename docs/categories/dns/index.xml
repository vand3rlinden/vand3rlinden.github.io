      <description>This blog post explains how an MTA STS policy works and how to implement it on GitHub Pages.
MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security) is a security protocol designed to improve the security of email communication by enforcing the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt email traffic between mail servers. It helps prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and downgrade attacks, where an attacker could intercept or tamper with email messages in transit.</description>

      <description>In this post, you will learn how to enable and use SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online.
While outbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online has been enabled since 2022, Microsoft is currently rolling out inbound SMTP DANE with DNSSEC in Exchange Online. It is currently in public preview, with General Availability expected in October 2024. In an earlier blog post, I explained how SMTP DANE with DNSSEC works together on a mail and web server.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role and Benefits of ARC Sealing</title>
      <link>https://vand3rlinden.com/post/arc-explained/</link>

      <description>This blog post explains the role and benefits of ARC sealing.
ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) is an email authentication protocol that preserves the authentication results of an email as it travels through multiple intermediaries, such as forwarding services.
By using ARC, organizations can better manage the complexities of email authentication, especially when email is forwarded, but ARC is a collaboration of multiple servers that trust each other.
ARC ensures that legitimate emails are less likely to be marked as spam or rejected, while fraudulent emails are more easily identified and filtered out.</description>

      <description>In this post, you find out how DNSSEC and DANE cooperate, and learn how to set up DANE TLSA DNS records.
DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) The domain name system (DNS) is the phone book of the Internet: it tells computers where to send and retrieve information. Unfortunately, it also accepts any address given to it, no questions asked.
DNSSEC adds a security layer to this phonebook. It uses digital signatures to make sure the information in the phonebook can be trusted and hasn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with.</description>

      <title>Get a handle on your SPF record</title>

      <description>In this post, I will share my best practices for getting a handle on your SPF record.
Why it makes sense to have a good SPF procedure in place In a previous blog post, I explained the limitations of SPF and how it works with DKIM and DMARC. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial to have a well-structured SPF procedure to avoid future problems, especially since exceeding the DNS lookup limit of 10 can cause issues, such as:</description>

      <description>In this post you will learn to understand how the DNS protocols SPF, DKIM and DMARC work together to protect your domain from phishers and spammers.
Why deploy SPF, DKIM, and DMARC? SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are critical email authentication protocols that help prevent email spoofing, phishing attacks, and domain impersonation for outbound email. Enabling these protocols together strengthens your domain&amp;rsquo;s email authentication mechanisms, improves security, and builds trust with your recipients by ensuring that email sent from your domain is legitimate and trustworthy.</description>
